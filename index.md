## About Me

Hi there, I'm Lavkush.
<br>
Master in Computer Science from UDCS, University of Mumbai with a Specialization in Data Science.
<br>
Passionate about making machine learn and make world a happy place.

## Interests

- **Machine Learning:** ML Algorithms, Clustering & Classification, Predictive Analysis, Visualization
- **Computer Vision:** Image recognition, Image generation


## Machine Learning Projects
- **House Price Prediction with Advanced Linear Regression with Scikit Learn** 
<br>In this Project, we're going to predict the price of a house using information like its location, area, no. of rooms etc. we'll use the dataset from the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle.

- **Twittter Sentiment Analyser** 
<br>In this Machine Learning Project, we’ll build binary classification that puts tweets texts into one of two categories — negative or positive sentiment using Naives Bayes Assumption.
<br>[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/llavkush/HelloWorld/blob/master/Twitter_Sentiment_Analyzer%20(1).ipynb)

- **Covid19 Stats Chatbot Tracker For Telegram** 
<br>In this Project, we have build chatbot to track stats of covid19 cases in your district by providing pincode as an input using Rasa Framework and integrated it with Telegram Bots.

- **Online Fraud Prediction Using XGBoost** 
<br>Build a Online Fraud predictor using XGBoost Regressor using a Data from Kaggle Competition to predict whether the financial transaction is fradulent or Not.
<br>Performed a Exploratory Data Analysis and Performed Feature Eangineering achiving a Accuracy of 99% on Test Datasets

## Visualizations/EDA Projects
- **Exploratory Data Analysis on Crime Agianst Women in India** 
<br>In this Project, We have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on data collated from https://data.gov.in. It has state-wise and district level data on the various crimes committed against women between 2001 to 2014. Some crimes that are included are Rape, Kidnapping and Abduction, Dowry Deaths etc.

## Deep Learning Projects

- **Cat Breeds Image Classification Using Pytorch** 
<br>Designing and Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to Identify Cat Breed from the given Image
<br>[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/llavkush/HelloWorld/blob/master/Cat_breed_image_classificationmodel.ipynb)

- **Cotton Disease Predictor** 
<br>In this Machine Learning Project, we build a disease predictor using Inception V3 model and trained on 4 class of images..
