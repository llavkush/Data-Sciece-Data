## About Me

Hi there, I'm Lavkush.
<br>
Master in Computer Science from UDCS, University of Mumbai with a Specialization in Data Science.
<br>
Passionate about making machine learn and make world a happy place.

## Interests

- **Machine Learning:** ML Algorithms, Clustering & Classification, Predictive Analysis, Visualization
- **Computer Vision:** Image recognition, Image generation


## Machine Learning Projects
- **House Price Prediction with Advanced Linear Regression with Scikit Learn.ipynb** 
<br>In this Project, we're going to predict the price of a house using information like its location, area, no. of rooms etc. we'll use the dataset from the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle.
